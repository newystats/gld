RS parameterisation l3=0 or l4=0 limit results

Check if the sorting in pgl() is worth the computational cost

? support named elements of the vector for parameters ?

Lmoments from parameters

Should moment fitting return object of class starship? Copy class name 
to FitFKML

Estimation of FKML with moments for data as well as given moment values

Fix plot.fittedgld to have a slightly higher upper ylim

L Moments for other types in gld.lmoments

New class for FKML estimates - as well as class starship
