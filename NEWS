2.6.4 
New function fit.fkml.moment() - does the same as fit.fkml(method="MoM")
na.rm now works for starship method in fit.gpd

2.6.3
New maintainer email address
fit.gpd() now allows method="starship", then calls starship()

2.6.2
gl.check.lambda bugfix

2.6.1
Add LambdaZeroEpsilon argument to fit.gpd to allow wider range of Lambda values to count as zero, and thus Quantile Based Skew Logistic.  


2.6
plot method for starship, plot.starship now defaults to one.page=FALSE
The fit.fkml function now;
* Returns and prints trimming values in Trimmed mean estimates
* Has the LMom method which is trimmed mean with zero trimming
* Has MoM, method of moments

2.5
Standard Errors for the L Moment estimates for the GPD type
fit.gpd defaults to recording cpu time usage (so that it is the
same as fit.fkml)

2.4.2
Fix bug in fit.gpd
BetaLambdaLambda function added (utility function for gpd L-Moment estimation)

2.4.1
Fix pgl() example comment - inverse.eps had defaulted to .Machine$double.eps since version 1.9

2.4
L Moment estimation for the GPD type

2.3.3 
print.starship, summary.starship and plot.starship now display 
estimation method and gld type

2.3
Moment estimation for FKML type
qdgl function deprecated in favour of dqgl as it calculates the density quantile function of the gld

2.2
New estimation methods for the FKML parameterisation:
Numerical MLE, Maximum Spacings Product, Titteringtons, L Moments,
TL Moments, Distributional Least Absolutes
Starship has C speedups from Ben Dean, in fit.fkml function
