Changes in version 2.6.6
  - Fix function prototype error in C code for RS type

Changes in version 2.6.5
  - Fix documentation CRAN issues - nested <em>, escaped &

Changes in version 2.6.4 
  - New function fit.fkml.moment() - does the same as fit.fkml(method="MoM")
  - na.rm now works for starship method in fit.gpd

Changes in version 2.6.3
  - New maintainer email address
  - fit.gpd() now allows method="starship", then calls starship()

Changes in version 2.6.2
  - gl.check.lambda bugfix

Changes in version 2.6.1
  - Add LambdaZeroEpsilon argument to fit.gpd to allow wider range of Lambda values to count as zero, and thus Quantile Based Skew Logistic.  
Changes in version 2.6
  - plot method for starship, plot.starship now defaults to one.page=FALSE
  - The fit.fkml function now;
    * Returns and prints trimming values in Trimmed mean estimates
    * Has the LMom method which is trimmed mean with zero trimming
    * Has MoM, method of moments

Changes in version 2.5
  - Standard Errors for the L Moment estimates for the GPD type fit.gpd defaults to recording cpu time usage (so that it is the same as fit.fkml)

Changes in version 2.4.2
  - Fix bug in fit.gpd
  - BetaLambdaLambda function added (utility function for gpd L-Moment estimation)

Changes in version 2.4.1
  - Fix pgl() example comment - inverse.eps had defaulted to .Machine$double.eps since version 1.9

Changes in version 2.4
  - L Moment estimation for the GPD type

Changes in version 2.3.3 
  - print.starship, summary.starship and plot.starship now display  estimation method and gld type

Changes in version 2.3
  - Moment estimation for FKML type
  - qdgl function deprecated in favour of dqgl as it calculates the density quantile function of the gld

Changes in version 2.2
  - New estimation methods for the FKML parameterisation: Numerical MLE, Maximum Spacings Product, Titteringtons, L Moments, TL Moments, Distributional Least Absolutes
  - Starship has C speedups from Ben Dean, in fit.fkml function
